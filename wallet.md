# Wallet Management

This application will make easy for you to manage everything in your wallet.

In your wallet you can put your:

- ID
- Money
- Credit Cards
- Driver's Licence
- Visit Card
- ID's Photo

## ID

1) Attributes

An ID contains:

- lastname
- firstname
- birthdate
- birthplace
- ID's Number
- address

2) How it works

When you put your ID in the wallet for the first time, the wallet will keep your ID number.
Then if you take it out and put another inside, the wallet will warn you that it is not yours.

## Money

1) How it works

You can deposit, withdraw and watch your balance.
When you withdraw, the wallet will tell you if you do not have enough in your wallet (which means you're poor).

## Credit Cards

1) Attributes

A credit card contains:

- digits as reference
- owner (you)
- origin (the bank that gave it to you)
- type

2) How it works

Same as the ID, when you put a card in your wallet, the wallet will keep the digits and type so you can easily search for your specific card.

## Driver's Licence

1) Attributes

A DL contains:

- lastname
- firstname
- birthdate
